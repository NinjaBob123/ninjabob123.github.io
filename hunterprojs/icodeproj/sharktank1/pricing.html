    <p>The <a href="model1.html">$30</a> option is the best suited for small homes (Under 10K square foot). <br>The <a href="model2.html">$100</a> option is better suited for 10K+ square foot homes. It is more powerful and can intake and output
    much more square feet per second. It combines 4 of the smaller models for more power. <br>However, if you are looking for the beefiest, most powerful model, built for overall planetary carbon reduction, that is the most modern model. The <a href="model3.html">$10,000</a> option.
    We have payment plans to spread out the payment over 1-5 years with only 0.5% simple interest. See plans on the model page.</p>
