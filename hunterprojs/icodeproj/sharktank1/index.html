    <h1>What is The Box</h1>
    <!--img of box aligned to right-->
    <p>The Box is a black box that you place in your window. It works by taking in the outside air from the window.<br>
      Then it separates the carbon dioxide from the air and uses it to carbonate sulfuric acid which is in the box.<br>
      Then it shakes up the sulfuric acid and bubbles out the oxygen released. <br>
      With the carbon buildup from the carbon dioxide, we burn it to power The Box.</p>
