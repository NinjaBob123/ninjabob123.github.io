Hello Sharks, I am the invenvtor of The Box. The Box is a black box that goes in your window or air conditioning intake unit. It separates the pollutants out of the air, and turns the Carbon Dioxide into breathable oxygen.
My target audience is asthmatics because it purifies the air, making it easier for them to breath. I am asking for 50 thousand for 10% equity. I will use the money mainly for getting materials because the acid mixture that we use to separate the carbon
out of the CO2 can be expensive. I know, I said acid. It is risk-free because of the spill-free containment unit. It is made out of industial-grade metal, so the acid won't be getting through. I will be advertizing through Social Media ads and billboards.
Questions?
