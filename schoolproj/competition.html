    <h1>
      <p>Our competitors in the home security field use cameras to record the criminals and use small lights to try to 
        scare them away, but don't do anything very discouraging. However, our competitors in the home defense field, 
        don't have very many non-lethal options</p>
      <div></div>
      <p>We combine the two into the Blindingly Safe product, where we use powerful flashlights to discourage breaking in, 
        or ever trying to break into anyone else's house either. To do this effectively, we use, in total, 800 000 lumens 
        on strobe to give them a fear of it happening again, effectively stopping their burglary/thieving career.</p>
