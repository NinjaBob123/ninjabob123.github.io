      <p>Our competitiors in the home security field use cameras to record the criminals, and use small lights to try to scare them away, but don't really do anything very discouraging. However, our competitors in the home defence field, don't have very many non-lethal options</p>
      <div></div>
      <p>We combine the two into the Blindingly Safe product, where we use powerful flashlights to discourage breaking in, or ever trying to break into any one elses house either. To do this effectivly, we use, in total, 800 000 lumens on strobe to give them a fear of it happening</p>
      <div></div>
      <p>again, effectivly stopping their burgalry/theifing career.</p>
