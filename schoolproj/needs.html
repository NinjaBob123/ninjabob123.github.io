    <h1>Why Should You Invest
      <p>You should invest because I believe that it will take over the home security and home defense market even with its higher price.
      <br>And because of its higher price, even with a low percentage of stock, you still make a lot.
      <br>Your money will help me to advertise and help me with hiring. Since production is very simple,
      <br>I do not think that I need your help with it. Another part of the business that your money would be helpful for
      <br>is the implementation into the buyer's home. The reason for this is because people probably wouldn't trust ex-cons
      <br>to install something on their house while they are not there. I also need it because people probably wouldn't want to
      <br>work with ex-cons as they fear it may hurt their record.</p>
