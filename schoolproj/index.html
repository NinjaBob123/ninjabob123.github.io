      <h2>Our Mission
        <div></div>
        <p>Our mission is to provide protection for everyone, against everything without causing harm to said invaders, aka, without guns.</p>
        <div></div>
        <p>Also, instead of just having cameras to provide protection, we also have a primary discouragement device, very bright lights, to temporarily blind and scare the invader</p>
        <div></div>
        <p>In conclusion, yes, we are quite more costly than our competitors, but all they do is record it, send police, and fee you monthly</p>
        <div></div>
        <p>However, we only notify the police if they continue towards the house, but we also greatly discourage the intruder from breaking in in the first place.</p>
